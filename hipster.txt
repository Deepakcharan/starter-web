A webMethods messaging trigger subscribes to one or more publishable document types and processes instances of those document types. A webMethods messaging trigger can receive documents published to a webMethods messaging provider (Software AG Universal Messaging or webMethods Broker) or documents published locally by the Integration Server on which the trigger resides.
Each webMethods messaging trigger is composed of two basic pieces:
*A subscription to one or more publishable document types
*A service that processes instances of those publishable document types.
When a webMethods messaging trigger receives a document to which it subscribes from the messaging provider, Integration Server passes the document to the specified service and then invokes the service.
